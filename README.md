# Nyxstone

[![Github Cpp CI Badge](https://github.com/emproof-com/nyxstone/actions/workflows/cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emproof-com/nyxstone/actions/workflows/cpp.yml)

Nyxstone is an assembly and disassembly library based on LLVM. It doesnâ€™t require patches to the LLVM source tree and links against standard LLVM libraries available in most Linux distributions. Implemented in C++, Nyxstone also offers Rust and Python bindings. It supports all official LLVM architectures and allows configuration of architecture-specific target settings.

## Core Features

- Assembles and Disassembles code for all architectures supported by LLVM 15, including x86 & x86_64, ARM & AArch64, MIPS, PowerPC, AVR, AMDGPU, NVPTX, RISC-V, and more. For a comprehensive list, refer to `clang -print-targets`.
- C++ library based on LLVM with Rust and Python bindings.
- Native platform support for Linux and macOS.
- Facilitates setting a custom start address and defining labels within assembly inputs, along with the ability to specify a label-to-address mapping through an additional argument.
- Assembles and disassembles to raw bytes or text respectively, or to detailed instruction objects that include additional information such as the instruction's address, raw bytes and its assembly representation.
- Provides an option to limit the number of instructions being disassembled from a given byte array.
- Supports the configuration of architecture-specific target features such as various Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions or hardware features. For a comprehensive list of features for each architecture, refer to `llc -march=ARCH -mattr=help`.

> [!NOTE]
> Disclaimer: Nyxstone has been primarily developed and tested on x86_64, AArch64 and ARM architectures. We have a high degree of confidence in its ability to accurately generate assembly and identify errors for these platforms. For other architectures, Nyxstone's effectiveness is dependent on the reliability and performance of their respective LLVM backends.

## Using Nyxstone

There are multiple ways to use Nyxstone. Nyxstone was initially developed as a rust library, but the underlying c++ library and python bindings implemented via pybind11 are also available in this repository.

### Prerequisites

Building Nyxstone requires a modern compiler, we currently use `clang`.

Since the LLVM backend changes frequently with major releases, Nyxstone currently only supports LLVM major version 15.

For the c++ library, as well as the bindings, Nyxstone searches for `llvm-config` in the path
specified by the environment variable `NYXSTONE_LLVM_PREFIX` (specifically in the path `$NYXSTONE_LLVM_PREFIX/bin/`)
or in your `$PATH`. It then uses `llvm-config` to check that LLVM supports static linking and is major version 15
Then, all required LLVM libraries are searched via `llvm-config` and added as linker flags.

It is thus required for LLVM 15 to be installed on your system to build Nyxstone.
For newer Ubuntu/Debian versions LLVM 15 can be installed with the packages `llvm-15` and `llvm-15-dev`.
Note that these packages still require you to specify `NYXSTONE_LLVM_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-15/`.

Otherwise you can install LLVM 15 by
 - Using an external package manager, like `brew`
 - Building LLVM from source

Also make sure to install any libraries needed by your LLVM version for static linking.
These depend on your system, use `llvm-config --system-libs` to see the system linker flags needed when using LLVM.
On Ubuntu/Debian you will need the packages `zlib1g-dev` and `zlibstd-dev`.

### As a rust library

See the rust bindings [README](bindings/rust/README.md).

### As a python library

See the python bindings [README](bindings/python/README.md).

### As a c++ library

Nyxstone can be used by including its header `nyxstone.h`. Following is a small c++ example in which the creation
and usage of Nyxstone objects is presented. When building your program, make sure to link against LLVM 15.

Following is a small cmake example for linking against nyxstone. Nyxstone should be a in the subdirectory `nyxstone` in your project.

```cmake
# ...
# You can also link LLVM dynamically, as long as it is LLVM 15.

# search a custom directory for LLVM 15
find_package(LLVM 15 CONFIG PATHS your-llvm-15-path NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
# search LLVM 15 in your library directories
find_package(LLVM 15 CONFIG)

include_directories(${LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_definitions(${LLVM_DEFINITIONS})
llvm_map_components_to_libnames(llvm_libs core mc AllTargetsCodeGens AllTargetsAsmParsers AllTargetsDescs AllTargetsDisassemblers AllTargetsInfos AllTargetsMCAs)

add_subdirectory(nyxstone EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL) # Add nyxstone cmake without executables
include_directories(nyxstone/include)       # Nyxstone include directory

add_executable(your-executable your-sources.cpp)

target_link_libraries(your-executable nyxstone ${llvm_libs})
```

In the following we give an example of the different usages of Nyxstone.
[//]: # (Consult the documentation (TODO: link) for more detailed information) 


```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

#include "nyxstone.h"

int main(int, char**) {
    // Create the nyxstone instance:
    auto nyxstone {NyxstoneBuilder().with_triple("x86_64").build()};

    // Assemble to bytes
    std::vector<uint8_t> bytes {};
    nyxstone->assemble_to_bytes(/*assembly=*/"mov rax, rbx", /*address=*/0x1000, /* labels= */ {}, bytes);
    {
        std::vector<uint8_t> expected {0x48, 0x89, 0xd8};
        assert(bytes == expected);
    }

    // Assemble with additional information
    std::vector<Nyxstone::Instruction> instrs {};

    }

    // Assemble with inline label
    nyxstone->assemble_to_instructions("je .label; nop; .label:", 0x1000, {}, instrs);
    {

            Nyxstone::Instruction {/*address=*/0x1000, /*assembly=*/"je .label", /*bytes=*/ {0x74, 0x01}},
            Nyxstone::Instruction {/*address=*/0x1002, /*assembly=*/"nop", /*bytes=*/ {0x90}},
        };
        assert(instrs == expected);
    }

    // Assemble with external label
    nyxstone->assemble_to_bytes("jmp .label", 0x1000, {Nyxstone::LabelDefinition {".label", 0x100}}, bytes);
    {
        std::vector<uint8_t> expected {0xe9, 0xfb, 0xf0, 0xff, 0xff};
        assert(bytes == expected);
    }

    // Disassemble some bytes
    std::string disassembly;
    nyxstone->disassemble_to_text(

    // Disassemble only one instruction of the bytes
    nyxstone->disassemble_to_text(
        /*bytes=*/ {0x48, 0x31, 0xc0, 0x66, 0x83, 0xc4, 0x08},

            Nyxstone::Instruction {/*address=*/0x1003, /*assembly=*/"add sp, 8", /*bytes=*/ {0x66, 0x83, 0xc4, 0x08}},
        };
        assert(instrs == expected);
    }

    // Configure nyxstone to your liking:
    nyxstone = std::move(
        NyxstoneBuilder()
            .with_triple("thumbv8")
            .with_immediate_style(NyxstoneBuilder::IntegerBase::HexPrefix)  // Change the printing style of immediates
            .with_features("+mve.fp,+fp16")  // Enable additional cpu features, here floating point instructions
            .build());

    // This fp instruction can be assembled via the new nyxstone instance
    nyxstone->assemble_to_bytes("vadd.f16 s0, s1", 0x1000, {}, bytes);
    {
        std::vector<uint8_t> expected {0x30, 0xee, 0x20, 0x09};
        assert(bytes == expected);
    }

    // And the disassembly immediates are printed in hexadecimal style with a 0x-prefix
    nyxstone->assemble_to_instructions("mov r0, #16", 0x1000, {}, instrs);
    {
        std::vector<Nyxstone::Instruction> expected {Nyxstone::Instruction {
            /*address=*/0x1000,
            /*assembly=*/"mov.w r0, #0x10",
            /*bytes=*/ {0x4f, 0xf0, 0x10, 0x00}}};
        assert(instrs == expected);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

See also the [sample program](examples/sample.cpp) and the [cli tool](examples/nyxstone-cli.cpp).

### The nyxstone example cli tool

The Nyxstone cli tool allows for on-the-fly assembling and disassembling from your command line.

Requires boosts `program_options` to be installed on your system.

After building the tool with cmake
```
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

you can print a help message:
```
$ ./nyxstone --help
Allowed options:
  --help                    Show this message
  --arch arg (=x86_64)      LLVM triple or architecture identifier of triple,
                            for example "x86_64", "x86_64-linux-gnu", "armv8",
                            "armv8eb", "thumbv8", "aarch64"
  --address arg (=0)        Address

Assembling:
  --labels arg              Labels, for example "label0=0x10,label1=0x20"
  -A [ --assemble ] arg     Assembly

Disassembling:
  -D [ --disassemble ] arg  Byte code in hex, for example: "0203"

```

As well as assemble and disassemble for different architectures:

```
$ ./nyxstone --arch "x86_64 " -A "mov rax, rbx"
Assembled:
	0x00000000: mov rax, rbx - [ 48 89 d8 ]
$ ./nyxstone --arch "x86_64" -A "je .label; add rax, rbx; .label:" --address 0x1000
Assembled:
	0x00001000: je .label - [ 74 03 ]
	0x00001002: add rax, rbx - [ 48 01 d8 ]
$ ./nyxstone --arch "x86_64" -A "jmp .label" --labels ".label=0x1000"
Assembled:
	0x00000000: jmp .label - [ e9 fb 0f 00 00 ]
$ ./nyxstone --arch "armv8" -A "eor r0, r1, r2, lsl #4"
Assembled:
	0x00000000: eor r0, r1, r2, lsl #4 - [ 02 02 21 e0 ]
$ ./nyxstone --arch "thumbv8" -D "13 37"
Disassembled:
	0x00000000: adds r7, #19 - [ 13 37 ]
```

## How it works

Nyxstone leverages public C++ API functions from LLVM such as `Target::createMCAsmParser` and `Target::createMCDisassembler` to perform assembly and disassembly tasks. Nyxstone also extends two LLVM classes - `MCELFStreamer` and `MCObjectWriter` - to inject custom logic and extract additional information. Specifically, Nyxstone augments the assembly process with the following steps: 
- `ELFStreamerWrapper::emitInstruction`
    - Capture assembly representation and initial raw bytes of instructions if detailed instruction objects are requested by the user.
- `ObjectWriterWrapper::writeObject`
    - Writes the final raw bytes of instructions, with relocation adjustments, to detailed instruction objects.
    - Switches raw bytes output from complete ELF file to just the .text section.
- `ObjectWriterWrapper::validate_fixups`
    - Conducts extra checks, such as verifying the range and alignment of relocations.
- `ObjectWriterWrapper::recordRelocation`
    - Applies additional relocations. `MCObjectWriter` skips some relocations that are only applied during linking. Right now this is only relevant for the `fixup_aarch64_pcrel_adrp_imm21` in the Aarch64 `adrp` instruction.

While extending LLVM classes introduces some drawbacks, like a strong dependency on a specific LLVM version, we believe this approach is still an improvement over alternatives that require hard to maintain patches in the LLVM source tree. We are committed to further remove complexity from the project and welcome suggestions for improvement. Looking ahead, we may eliminate the need to extend LLVM classes by leveraging the existing LLVM infrastructure in a smarter way or incorporating additional logic in a post-processing step.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Native Windows platform support
- [ ] Check thread safety
- [ ] Add support for more LLVM versions (auto select depending on found LLVM library version)
- [ ] Add dynamic linking support, e. g., Arch Linux has LLVM libraries without static linking support
